                <p>
                    With over a decade of work crafting visuals, I've shaped content across every corner of video
                    production. From award-winning short films to polished commercial campaigns to high stakes live
                    production, my career has spanned wide and deep across New Zealand and Australian markets.
                    <br><br>
                    My approach combines technical precision with creative flair. Whether I'm building motion graphics
                    from scratch, grading footage to set the perfect mood, or crafting compelling narratives from
                    interview footage, beyond the technical skills, is a deep understanding of storytelling fundamentals
                    and a dedication to finding the right approach for each project. My experience with working in
                    larger teams and agencies as well as freelance means I not only create content - I can help ensure
                    smooth workflows from concept to delivery.
                    <br><br>
                    When I'm not in the edit suite, you'll find me behind the camera or diving into new creative
                    technologies. I thrive on variety and am always excited to take on new challenges – drop me a line
                    and let’s get coffee and chat!
                </p>
                <!-- <p>
                    I'm a Freelance Video Editor/Motion Graphics Designer and Videographer.<br><br>

                    I first got into video when I was training as an Actor at Toi Whakaari: NZ Drama School in
                    Wellington. I love acting and always wanted to do more than was being offered to me, so the logical
                    step was to start making my own films. Soon I found the video work was far outweighing my acting
                    work and it became my main occupation.
                    <br><br>
                    After 3 Years experience working as an Editor and Cameraman for DDB in Auckland, I decided to branch
                    out into Freelancing in late 2016. Since then I have worked on several varied and fun projects
                    including Directing as well as Editing.
                    <br><br>
                    I enjoy all aspects of film making and have made several successful films including taking out Grand
                    National Champion of the 48 Hour film competition in 2015 with our film "Breadwinner".
                    <br><br>
                    I like working on a variety of different projects in different roles and when Directing, I bring the
                    twin perspectives of an Actor and Editor, allowing me to hold a strong vision for the project and
                    communicate it clearly with creative and technical people alike. Please get in touch if you would
                    like to work with me.
                </p> -->
