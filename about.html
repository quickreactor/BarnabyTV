                <p>
                    I'm a Freelance Video Editor and Videographer.<br><br>
    
                    I first got into Video Editing when I was training as an Actor at Toi Whakaari: NZ Drama School in Wellington. I love acting and always wanted to do more than was being offered to me, so the logical step was to start making my own films. Soon I found the video work was far outweighing my acting work and it became my main occupation.
                    <br><br>
                    After 3 Years experience working as an Editor and Cameraman for DDB in Auckland, I decided to branch out into Freelancing in late 2016. Since then I have worked on several varied and fun projects including Directing as well as Editing.
                    <br><br>
                    I enjoy all aspects of film making and have made several successful films including taking out Grand National Champion of the 48 Hour film competition in 2015 with our film "Breadwinner".
                    <br><br>
                    I like working on a variety of different projects in different roles and when Directing, I bring the twin perspectives of an Actor and Editor, allowing me to hold a strong vision for the project and communicate it clearly with creative and technical people alike. Please get in touch if you would like to work with me.
